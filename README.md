## The Gitignore file

While creating this repo GitHub asked what Gitignore file I wanted to use. I write a lot of code using Visual Studio, so I selected the Gitignore for Visual Studio. Note, however, that isn't really what I'd want to have, as this repo is for documentation, rather than coding. But, off the top of my head, I don't know what Gitignore file would be better, or if any is needed at all.
